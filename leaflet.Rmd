This page shows a map of some good pickup game parks around Houston, TX.


```{r start, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
parks <- data.frame(name = c("Love Park", "Godwin Park", "Memorial Park", "Hermann Park", "Montie Beach Park"),
                    lat = c(29.793818, 29.672229, 29.764306, 29.720483, 29.800291),
                    lng = c(-95.407788, -95.468602, -95.445741, -95.390386, -95.380743),
                    cols = c("green", "green", "red", "red", "red")
                    )
themap <- parks %>% 
          leaflet() %>% 
          addTiles() %>% 
          addCircleMarkers(label = parks$name, color = parks$cols) %>%
          addLegend(labels = c("weekends", "weekdays"), colors = c("green", "red"))
